  <br />
  <br />
</i>When Samuel Zemurray arrived in America in 1891, he was tall, gangly, and penniless. When he died in the grandest house in New Orleans sixty-nine years later, he was among the richest, most powerful men in the world. In between, he worked as a fruit peddler, a banana hauler, a dockside hustler, and a plantation owner. He battled and conquered the United Fruit Company, becoming a symbol of the best and worst of the United States: proof that America is the land of opportunity, but also a classic example of the corporate pirate who treats foreign nations as the backdrop for his adventures. In Latin America, when people shouted “Yankee, go home!” it was men like Zemurray they had in mind.<br /><br />            Rich Cohen’s brilliant historical profile <i>The Fish That Ate the Whale</i> unveils Zemurray as a hidden kingmaker and capitalist revolutionary, driven by an indomitable will to succeed. Known as El Amigo, the Gringo, or simply Z, the Banana Man lived one of the great untold stories of the last hundred years. Starting with nothing but a cart of freckled bananas, he built a sprawling empire of banana cowboys, mercenary soldiers, Honduran peasants, CIA agents, and American statesmen. From hustling on the docks of New Orleans to overthrowing Central American governments, from feuding with Huey Long to working with the Dulles brothers, Zemurray emerges as an unforgettable figure, connected to the birth of modern American diplomacy, public relations, business, and war—a monumental life that reads like a parable of the American dream.<br /><br /><br /><i></i><br /><br />",16283,Rich Cohen,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316898307p5/16283.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1316898307p2/16283.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16283.Rich_Cohen,3.95,21553,2598,,18345809,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.6-RnzSU6QS__Ur-lHWbe1A,read,true,291413955,,,,,2023

Then, he turned his attention to a new topic: the society around him. Why was everything such a mess? Why was everyone acting like such a baby? When did things get so tribal? Why do humans do this stuff?<br /><br />This massive topic sent Tim tumbling down his deepest rabbit hole yet, through mountains of history, evolutionary psychology, political theory, neuroscience, and modern-day political movements, as he tried to figure out the answer to a simple question: What’s our problem?<br /><br />Six years later, he emerged from the hole holding this book. What’s Our Problem? is a deep and expansive analysis of our modern times, in the classic style of Wait But Why, packed with original concepts, sticky metaphors, and 300 drawings. The book provides an entirely new framework and language for thinking and talking about today’s complex world. Instead of focusing on the usual left-center-right horizontal political axis, which is all about what we think, the book introduces a verticalaxis that explores how we think, as individuals and as groups.

With that in mind, Harvard Business School professor Deepak Malhotra offers a radically different answer to this question.</p><p>Malhotra tells an inspiring story about three unique and adventurous mice—Max, Big, and Zed—who refuse to accept their reality as given. As we watch their lives unfold and intersect, we discover that instead of just blindly chasing after the cheese, each of us has the ability to escape the maze or even reconfigure it to our liking.</p><p>In the face of established practices, traditional ideas, scarce resources, and the powerful demands or expectations of others, we often underestimate our ability to control our own destiny and overcome the constraints we face—or think we face. I Moved Your Cheese reminds us that we can create the new circumstances and realities we want, but first we must discard the often deeply ingrained notion that we are nothing more than mice in someone else’s maze. As Zed explains, “You see, Max, the problem is not that the mouse is in the maze, but that the maze is in the mouse.”</p><p>“Every once in a while a book comes along that makes you question the way things are. This is the book. Deepak Malhotra allows you to glimpse a world of your own making without the limits and barriers that others create. An excellent read.”<br /> <b>—Stephen R. Covey, author of <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> and </b><i><b>The Leader in Me</b></i></p><p>“A magnificent story with a powerful message. As someone who has encouraged scores of professionals into breaking through the maze and defining their own pursuits, I find this to be a gem of a book. A must-read.”<br /> <b>—Vinod Khosla, cofounder and former CEO and Chairman, Sun Microsystems, and founder, Khosla Ventures</b></p><p>“Deepak Malhotra tackles our assumptions about business and life with humor, zest, and wisdom in this delightful fable. If you’ve ever rankled at the thought of being just another mouse in the maze, this is the book for you.”<br /> <b>—Daniel H. Pink, author of <i>Drive</i> and </b><i><b>A Whole New Mind</b></i></p><p>“Deepak Malhotra’s lucid fable, I Moved Your Cheese, is a brilliant counterpoint to Spencer Johnson’s earlier work.

But will he be transformed into something more than human… or something less?<br /><br />When the SWAT team gives the all-clear and Logan Ramsay steps into the basement, he has no idea that everything's about to change.<br /><br />Then there's the hiss of aerosol. The explosion. The shrapnel that punctures his hazmat gear. Logan wakes up to find himself in a hospital bed, attended by doctors in their own hazmat suits, his wife and daughter looking on from behind the glass.<br /><br />The doctors say he's been infected by a virus - one designed not to make him sick, but to modify his very genetic structure. In a world where the next-generation gene-editing tool known as Scythe is widely available - and has already reaped disastrous consequences - the possibilities are too many and terrifying to count.<br /><br />Except that after the fever, the pain, the fear... the virus is gone. And according to his government bosses, Logan's got a clean bill of health.<br /><br />But the truth is that with each day that passes, Logan's getting smarter. Seeing things more clearly. He's realizing that he's been upgraded in ways that go beyond even Scythe's capabilities - and that he's been given these abilities for a reason.<br /> <br />Because a holy grail of genetic engineering - one that could change our very definitions of humanity - has just been unearthed. And now it's up to him to stop it from falling into the wrong hands. <br /> <br />Logan’s becoming something more. Something better.

In a departure from many analytical approaches, Colburn and Aldern shift their focus from the individual experiencing homelessness to the metropolitan area. Using accessible statistical analysis, they test a range of conventional beliefs about what drives the prevalence of homelessness in a given city—including mental illness, drug use, poverty, weather, generosity of public assistance, and low-income mobility—and find that none explain the regional variation observed across the country. Instead, housing market conditions, such as the cost and availability of rental housing, offer a far more convincing account.

Architect Ryan Gravel argues that this can change. Cities have the infrastructure and capability to create a healthier, more satisfying way of life by remodeling and augmenting different parts of cities to connect neighborhoods and communities. Gravel came up with a way to do just that in his hometown with the Atlanta Beltline project, a 22-mile looped path built on long-dormant intersecting rail lines. It connects 40 diverse Atlanta neighborhoods to city schools, shopping districts, and public parks, and has already seen a huge payoff in real estate development and local business revenue.<br /><br />Similar projects are in the works around the country, from the Los Angeles River Revitalization and the Buffalo Bayou in Houston to the Midtown Greenway in Minneapolis and the Underline in Miami.

As other cities try to solve the riddle of creating vibrant economies, many have looked to Seattle as a model for tech-driven urban renaissance. However, that success comes with skyrocketing housing costs, increasing homelessness, public safety concerns, persistent racial inequality, and a widening gap between the haves and have-nots. Against that backdrop, big tech has become a popular target.<br /><br /><br /><br />Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist who was one of the first investors in Amazon, draws on his experience in Seattle's tech boom to offer a vision for how cities and businesses can build a brighter future together. He explores ways that cities can soar to prosperity by creating the conditions that encourage innovation. Like flywheels, livable cities generate momentum by drawing creative citizens who launch businesses. Success attracts more talent, energizing local economies and accelerating further innovation. Alberg emphasizes the importance of city governments and tech companies partnering to address civic challenges. He reflects on why the benefits of the tech boom have not been distributed equally and what business and government leaders must do differently to ensure inclusive growth. The book also examines success stories from smaller cities and their lessons for other up-and-coming tech hubs. Demonstrating the need for innovative thinking that encourages livability alongside economic growth, <i>Flywheels</i> is timely reading for everyone from mayors to business leaders to engaged citizens.",21427836,Tom Alberg,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21427836.Tom_Alberg,3.18,11,1,2021,90628654,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.GLkvZ4Q-WFdz7Wyl,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the <i>Toy Story</i> trilogy, <i>Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, </i>and<i> WALL-E, </i>which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really <i>is</i>. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable.<br />  <br /> As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his founding Pixar with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter in 1986. Nine years later, <i>Toy Story</i> was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:<br />  <br /> • Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.<br /> • If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. <br /> • It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them.<br /> • The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them. <br /> • A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.<br /> • Do not assume that general agreement will lead to change—it takes substantial energy to move a group, even when all are on board.",5618463,Ed Catmull,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1404701341p5/5618463.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1404701341p2/5618463.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5618463.Ed_Catmull,4.22,88799,5333,,25384143,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.N9UZ8Q8SBQ5UJqhhREnSRw,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

The London-born genius was the second-most powerful person at Apple and the creative force who most embodies Jobs's spirit, the man who designed the products adopted by hundreds of millions the world over: the iPod, iPad, MacBook Air, the iMac G3, and the iPhone. In the wake of his close collaborator's death, the chief designer wrestled with grief and initially threw himself into his work designing the new Apple headquarters and the Watch before losing his motivation in a company increasingly devoted more to margins than to inspiration.<br /><br />In many ways, Cook was Ive's opposite. The product of a small Alabama town, he had risen through the ranks from the supply side of the company. His gift was not the creation of new products. Instead, he had invented countless ways to maximize a margin, squeezing some suppliers, persuading others to build factories the size of cities to churn out more units. He considered inventory evil. He knew how to make subordinates sweat with withering questions.<br /><br />Jobs selected Cook as his successor, and Cook oversaw a period of tremendous revenue growth that has lifted Apple's valuation to $2 trillion. He built a commanding business in China and rapidly distinguished himself as a master politician who could forge global alliances and send the world's stock market into freefall with a single sentence.<br /><br />Author Tripp Mickle spoke with more than 200 current and former Apple executives, as well as figures key to this period of Apple's history, including Trump administration officials and fashion luminaries such as Anna Wintour while writing <em>After Steve</em>. His research shows the company's success came at a cost. Apple lost its innovative spirit and has not designed a new category of device in years. Ive's departure in 2019 marked a culmination in Apple's shift from a company of innovation to one of operational excellence, and the price is a company that has lost its soul.",20651167,Tripp Mickle,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1650467881p5/20651167.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1650467881p2/20651167.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20651167.Tripp_Mickle,4.10,2076,198,,92439712,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.eeT34qlnRgF9rmbX,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

If we can understand what makes these gatherings effective and memorable, then we can reframe and redirect them to benefit everyone, host and guest alike. Parker defines a gathering as three or more people who come together for a specific purpose. When we understand why we gather, she says -- to acknowledge, to learn, to challenge, to change -- we learn how to organize gatherings that are relevant and memorable: from an effective business meeting to a thought-provoking conference; from a joyful wedding to a unifying family dinner. Drawing on her experience as a strategic facilitator who's worked with such organizations as the World Economic Forum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the retail company Fresh, Parker explains how ordinary people can create remarkable occasions, large and small. In dozens of fascinating examples, she breaks down the alchemy of these experiences to show what goes into the good ones and demonstrates how we can learn to incorporate those elements into all of our gatherings. The result is a book that's both journey and guide, full of big ideas with real-world applications that will change the way you look at a business meeting, a parent-teacher conference, and a backyard barbecue.",17404456,Priya Parker,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1555794346p5/17404456.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1555794346p2/17404456.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17404456.Priya_Parker,3.99,16755,2298,2018,58588048,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.M2Kh7WTgMCV3Tzw9YuIWqQ,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

So is their reward, which is whispered to be NSA or CIA recruitment, vast wealth, immortality, or perhaps even the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe itself. But the deeper you get, the more deadly the game becomes. Players have died in the past—and the body count is rising. <br /><br />And now the eleventh round is about to begin. Enter K—a Rabbits obsessive who has been trying to find a way into the game for years. That path opens when K is approached by billionaire Alan Scarpio, the alleged winner of the sixth iteration. Scarpio says that something has gone wrong with the game and that K needs to fix it before Eleven starts or the whole world will pay the price. <br /><br />Five days later, Scarpio is declared missing.

  <b>The revolutionary movement behind the explosive growth of Intel, Google, Amazon and Uber. </b>
  <br />
  <b> With a foreword by Larry Page, and contributions from Bono and Bill Gates.</b>
</p><p> <i>Measure What Matters</i> is about using Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), a revolutionary approach to goal-setting, to make tough choices in business. </p><p> In 1999, legendary venture capitalist John Doerr invested nearly $12 million in a startup that had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. Doerr introduced the founders to OKRs and with them at the foundation of their management, the startup grew from forty employees to more than 70,000 with a market cap exceeding $600 billion. The startup was Google.</p><p> Since then Doerr has introduced OKRs to more than fifty companies, helping tech giants and charities exceed all expectations. In the OKR model objectives define what we seek to achieve and key results are how those top­ priority goals will be attained. OKRs focus effort, foster coordination and enhance workplace satisfaction. They surface an organization's most important work as everyone's goals from entry-level to CEO are transparent to the entire institution. </p><p> In <i>Measure What Matters,</i> Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations. </p><p> This book will show you how to collect timely, relevant data to track progress - to <i>measure what matters</i>. It will help any organization or team aim high, move fast, and excel. </p>",22373767,John Doerr,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22373767.John_Doerr,4.00,30787,2492,,54960827,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.uv_khF51NjlHlh6_Np4D2g,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2022

But as homeless encampments spread, and overdose deaths skyrocketed, Shellenberger decided to take a closer look at the problem.<br /><br />What he discovered shocked him. The problems had grown worse not despite but because of progressive policies. San Francisco and other West Coast cities — Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland — had gone beyond merely tolerating homelessness, drug dealing, and crime to actively enabling them.<br /><br /><em>San Fransicko</em> reveals that the underlying problem isn’t a lack of housing or money for social programs. The real problem is an ideology that designates some people, by identity or experience, as victims entitled to destructive behaviors. The result is an undermining of the values that make cities, and civilization itself, possible.",77403,Michael Shellenberger,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1666038092p5/77403.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1666038092p2/77403.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/77403.Michael_Shellenberger,4.11,8387,1285,,88515581,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.ocJDgsG6Ltd3QctO,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

Realizing early on that he could not compete and win by playing the same game his bigger competitors were playing, he decided to build a store for educated people of somewhat modest means. He brought in unusual products from around the world and promoted them in the <em>Fearless Flyer</em>, providing customers with background on how they were sourced and their nutritional value. He also gave the stores a tiki theme to reinforce the exotic trader ship concept with employees wearing Hawaiian shirts.<br /><br />In this way, Joe laid down a blueprint for other business owners to follow to build their own unique shopping experience that customers love, and a work environment that employees love being a part of.<br /><br />In <em>Becoming Trader Joe</em>, Joe shares the lessons he learned by challenging the status quo and rethinking the way a business operates. He shows readers of all types:<br /><br /><br />How moving from a pure analytical approach to a more creative, problem-solving approach can drive innovation.<br />How finding an affluent niche of passionate customers can be a better strategy than competing on price and volume.<br />How questioning all aspects of the way you do business leads to powerful results.<br />How to build a business around your values and identity.",16792937,Patty Civalleri,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1493763571p5/16792937.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1493763571p2/16792937.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16792937.Patty_Civalleri,3.48,2385,318,,87129918,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.PV_Q2fqc-oTBsV8Z,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2022

You've been wrapped up in a task, and you check the clock when you come up for air—4:44 pm. You go to check your email, and 44 unread messages have built up.

Or have you just seen the edge of a rabbit hole? <br /><br />Rabbits is a mysterious alternate reality game so vast it uses our global reality as its canvas. Since the game first started in 1959, ten iterations have appeared and nine winners have been declared. Their identities are unknown. So is their reward, which is whispered to be NSA or CIA recruitment, vast wealth, immortality, or perhaps even the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe itself. But the deeper you get, the more deadly the game becomes. Players have died in the past—and the body count is rising. <br /><br />And now the eleventh round is about to begin. Enter K—a Rabbits obsessive who has been trying to find a way into the game for years. That path opens when K is approached by billionaire Alan Scarpio, the alleged winner of the sixth iteration. Scarpio says that something has gone wrong with the game and that K needs to fix it before Eleven starts or the whole world will pay the price. <br /><br />Five days later, Scarpio is declared missing.

  <b>The future isn't about where we will work, but how. For years we have struggled to balance work and life, with most of us feeling overwhelmed and burned out because our relationship to work is broken. This ""isn't just a book about remote work. It's a book that helps us imagine a future where our lives--at the office <i>and</i> home--are happier, more productive, and genuinely meaningful"" (Charles Duhigg, best-selling author of <i>The Power of Habit</i>).</b>
</b><br /><br /><i>Out of Office</i> is a book for every office worker - from employees to managers - currently facing the decision about whether, and how, to return to the office. The past two years have shown us that there may be a new path forward, one that doesn't involve hellish daily commutes and the demands of jam-packed work schedules that no longer make sense. But how can we realize that future in a way that benefits workers and companies alike?<br /><br />Based on groundbreaking reporting and interviews with workers and managers around the world, <i> Out of Office </i>illuminates the key values and questions that should be driving this conversation: trust, fairness, flexibility, inclusive workplaces, equity, and work-life balance. Above all, they argue that companies need to listen to their employees - and that this will promote, rather than impede, productivity and profitability. As a society, we have talked for decades about flexible work arrangements; this book makes clear that we are at an inflection point where this is actually possible for many employees and their companies. <i>Out of Office</i> is about so much more than zoom meetings and hybrid schedules: it aims to reshape our entire relationship to the office.",20951643,Charlie Warzel,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20951643.Charlie_Warzel,3.76,2364,313,,87563549,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.HQFBPvzZYkUReW8F,read,true,291413955,,,,,2022

In <i>Empires of Light</i>, historian Jill Jonnes portrays this extraordinary trio and their riveting and ruthless world of cutting-edge science, invention, intrigue, money, death, and hard-eyed Wall Street millionaires. At the heart of the story are Thomas Alva Edison, the nation’s most famous and folksy inventor, creator of the incandescent light bulb and mastermind of the world’s first direct current electrical light networks; the Serbian wizard of invention Nikola Tesla, elegant, highly eccentric, a dreamer who revolutionized the generation and delivery of electricity; and the charismatic George Westinghouse, Pittsburgh inventor and tough corporate entrepreneur, an industrial idealist who in the era of gaslight imagined a world powered by cheap and plentiful electricity and worked heart and soul to create it. <br /><br />Edison struggled to introduce his radical new direct current (DC) technology into the hurly-burly of New York City as Tesla and Westinghouse challenged his dominance with their alternating current (AC), thus setting the stage for one of the eeriest feuds in American corporate history, the War of the Electric Currents. The battlegrounds: Wall Street, the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, Niagara Falls, and, finally, the death chamber - Jonnes takes us on the tense walk down a prison hallway and into the sunlit room where William Kemmler, convicted ax murderer, became the first man to die in the electric chair. <br /><br /><i>Empires of Light</i> is the gripping history of electricity, the “mysterious fluid,” and how the fateful collision of Edison, Tesla, and Westinghouse left the world utterly transformed.",282828,Jill Jonnes,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1448547998p5/282828.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1448547998p2/282828.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/282828.Jill_Jonnes,3.98,3885,532,,495976,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.rlgQlm_WSJO4rxvriuHSnA,read,true,291413955,,,,,2021

The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose office she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting.

And eventually, he learned to appreciate life all the more for it.<br /> <br />Everyone’s lives are touched by mental illness: if we do not suffer from it ourselves, then we have a friend or loved one who does.

Above all, his humor and encouragement never let us lose sight of hope.

Think again.<br /><br />As flagship of the American news media, the New York Times is the world’s most powerful news outlet. With thousands of reporters covering events from all corners of the globe, the Times has the power to influence wars, foment revolution, shape economies and change the very nature of our culture. It doesn’t just cover the news: it creates it.<br /><br />But the institution that is the New York Times is showing cracks.

It is frequently beset by scandal and has even emerged as a symbol of the political, cultural and social ills plaguing our society.<br /><br />The Gray Lady Winked pulls back the curtain on this illustrious institution to reveal a quintessentially human organization where ideology, ego, power and politics compete with the more humble need to present the facts. In its 10 gripping chapters, The Gray Lady Winked offers readers an eye-opening, often shocking, look at the New York Times’s greatest journalistic failures, so devastating they changed the course of history.<br /><br />These are the stories that mattered most, including the Times’s disastrous coverage of the:<br /><br />Second World War – Holocaust – Rise of the Soviet Union – Cuban Revolution – Vietnam War – Second Palestinian Intifada – Atomic Bombing of Japan – Iraq War – Founding of America<br /><br />The result is an essential look at the tangled relationship between media, power and politics in a post-truth world told with novelistic flair to reveal a uniquely powerful institution’s tortured relationship with the truth.<br /><br />Most importantly of all, The Gray Lady Winked presents a cautionary tale that shows what happens when the guardians of the truth abandon that sacred value in favor of self-interest and ideology—and what this means for our future as much as for our past.",4801419,Ashley Rindsberg,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1619344824p5/4801419.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1619344824p2/4801419.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4801419.Ashley_Rindsberg,3.95,524,74,2021,90618105,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.4IIg_VlVwbvDaOoV,read,true,291413955,,,,,2021

In other words, we have what Julia Galef calls a soldier mindset. From tribalism and wishful thinking, to rationalizing in our personal lives and everything in between, we are driven to defend the ideas we most want to believe--and shoot down those we don't.<br /><br />But if we want to get things right more often, argues Galef, we should train ourselves to have a scout mindset. Unlike the soldier, a scout's goal isn't to defend one side over the other. It's to go out, survey the territory, and come back with as accurate a map as possible. Regardless of what they hope to be the case, above all, the scout wants to know what's actually true.<br /><br />In <i>The Scout Mindset</i>, Galef shows that what makes scouts better at getting things right isn't that they're smarter or more knowledgeable than everyone else. It's a handful of emotional skills, habits, and ways of looking at the world--which anyone can learn. With fascinating examples ranging from how to survive being stranded in the middle of the ocean, to how Jeff Bezos avoids overconfidence, to how superforecasters outperform CIA operatives, to Reddit threads and modern partisan politics, Galef explores why our brains deceive us and what we can do to change the way we think.",18465951,Julia Galef,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1636036634p5/18465951.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1636036634p2/18465951.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18465951.Julia_Galef,4.14,4933,580,,65572070,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.5G5vR6Fy2H2a75AColX5-g,read,true,291413955,,,,,2021

Less than 20 years after its founding, it boasts the largest constellation of commercial satellites in orbit, has pioneered reusable rockets, and in 2020 became the first private company to launch human beings into orbit. Half a century after the space race it is private companies, led by SpaceX, standing alongside NASA pushing forward into the cosmos, and laying the foundation for our exploration of other worlds.<br /><br />But before it became one of the most powerful players in the aerospace industry, SpaceX was a fledgling startup, scrambling to develop a single workable rocket before the money ran dry. The engineering challenge was immense; numerous other private companies had failed similar attempts. And even if SpaceX succeeded, they would then have to compete for government contracts with titans such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who had tens of thousands of employees and tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. SpaceX had fewer than 200 employees and the relative pittance of $100 million in the bank.<br /><br />In <i>Liftoff</i>, Eric Berger, senior space editor at Ars Technica, takes readers inside the wild early days that made SpaceX. Focusing on the company’s first four launches of the Falcon 1 rocket, he charts the bumpy journey from scrappy underdog to aerospace pioneer. We travel from company headquarters in El Segundo, to the isolated Texas ranchland where they performed engine tests, to Kwajalein, the tiny atoll in the Pacific where SpaceX launched the Falcon 1. Berger has reported on SpaceX for more than a decade, enjoying unparalleled journalistic access to the company’s inner workings. Liftoff is the culmination of these efforts, drawing upon exclusive interviews with dozens of former and current engineers, designers, mechanics, and executives, including Elon Musk. The enigmatic Musk, who founded the company with the dream of one day settling Mars, is the fuel that propels the book, with his daring vision for the future of space.<br /><br />Filled with never-before-told stories of SpaceX’s turbulent beginning, <i>Liftoff</i> is a saga of cosmic proportions.",20786282,Eric  Berger,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1602088770p5/20786282.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1602088770p2/20786282.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20786282.Eric_Berger,4.49,4543,463,,75734217,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.tSS9Tl_QtOIWaE9a,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2021

He used examples from his own experiences to explain how high achievers can all too often fall into traps that lead to unhappiness.<br /><br />The speech was memorable not only because it was deeply revealing but also because it came at a time of intense personal reflection: Christensen had just overcome the same type of cancer that had taken his father's life. As Christensen struggled with the disease, the question ""How do you measure your life?"" became more urgent and poignant, and he began to share his insights more widely with family, friends, and students.<br /><br />In this groundbreaking book, Christensen puts forth a series of questions: How can I be sure that I'll find satisfaction in my career?

And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.<br /><br />Enter Mia Warren—an enigmatic artist and single mother—who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.<br /><br />When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town—and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs.<br /><br /><i>Little Fires Everywhere</i> explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, and the ferocious pull of motherhood—and the danger of believing that following the rules can avert disaster.<br /><br />Named a Best Book of the Year by: <i>People, The Washington Post, Bustle, Esquire, Southern Living, The Daily Beast, GQ, Entertainment Weekly, </i>NPR, Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, iBooks, Audible, Goodreads, Library Reads, Book of the Month, <i>Paste</i>, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch, </i>and many more...<br /><br /><b>Perfect for book clubs!

With the help of experts in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, political science, and finance, he has focused on what must be done in order to stop the planet's slide toward certain environmental disaster. In this book, he not only explains why we need to work toward net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, but also details what we need to do to achieve this profoundly important goal.<br /><br />He gives us a clear-eyed description of the challenges we face. Drawing on his understanding of innovation and what it takes to get new ideas into the market, he describes the areas in which technology is already helping to reduce emissions, where and how the current technology can be made to function more effectively, where breakthrough technologies are needed, and who is working on these essential innovations. Finally, he lays out a concrete, practical plan for achieving the goal of zero emissions-suggesting not only policies that governments should adopt, but what we as individuals can do to keep our government, our employers, and ourselves accountable in this crucial enterprise.<br /><br />As Bill Gates makes clear, achieving zero emissions will not be simple or easy to do, but if we follow the plan he sets out here, it is a goal firmly within our reach.",23470,Bill  Gates,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1669082055p5/23470.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1669082055p2/23470.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23470.Bill_Gates,4.07,54312,5149,2021,73626311,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v2.6f8fceb9-3680-4c94-92b8-4a7bb370e9ba,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2021

In <i>Working Backwards</i>, these two long-serving Amazon executives reveal and codify the principles and practices that drive the success of one of the most extraordinary companies the world has ever known. With twenty-seven years of Amazon experience between them, much of it in the early aughts—a period of unmatched innovation that brought products and services including Kindle, Amazon Prime, Amazon Studios, and Amazon Web Services to life—Bryar and Carr offer unprecedented access to the Amazon way as it was refined, articulated, and proven to be repeatable, scalable, and adaptable.<br /><br />With keen analysis and practical steps for applying it at your own company—no matter the size—the authors illuminate how Amazon’s fourteen leadership principles inform decision-making at all levels and reveal how the company’s culture has been defined by four characteristics: customer obsession, long-term thinking, eagerness to invent, and operational excellence. Bryar and Carr explain the set of ground-level practices that ensure these are translated into action and flow through all aspects of the business.<br /><br /><i>Working Backwards</i> is a practical guidebook and a corporate narrative, filled with the authors’ in-the-room recollections of what “Being Amazonian” is like and how it has affected their personal and professional lives. They demonstrate that success on Amazon’s scale is not achieved by the genius of any single leader, but rather through commitment to and execution of a set of well-defined, rigorously-executed principles and practices—shared here for the very first time. <b><br /><br />A Macmillan Audio production from St. Martin's Press<br /></b>",20202051,Colin Bryar,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1600213261p5/20202051.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1600213261p2/20202051.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20202051.Colin_Bryar,4.23,4732,463,,81650661,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.dJ0FAe66Z5Bf6-lB,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2021

It harnesses an unreal number—infinity—to tackle real‑world problems, breaking them down into easier ones and then reassembling the answers into solutions that feel miraculous. <br /> <br />Infinite Powers recounts how calculus tantalized and thrilled its inventors, starting with its first glimmers in ancient Greec<br />e and bringing us right up to the discovery of gravitational waves (a phenomenon predicted by calculus). Strogatz reveals how this form of math rose to the challenges of each age: how to determine the area of a circle with only sand and a stick; how to explain why Mars goes “backwards” sometimes; how to make electricity with magnets; how to ensure your rocket doesn’t miss the moon; how to turn the tide in the fight against AIDS. <br /> <br />As Strogatz proves, calculus is truly the language of the universe.

This book describes the proper way to view the markets and your portfolio, and show you the simple strategies that make investing more profitable, less confusing, and less time-consuming. Without the burden of short-term performance benchmarks, individual investors have the advantage of focusing on the long view, and the freedom to construct the kind of portfolio that will serve their investment goals best. This book proves how complex strategies essentially waste these advantages, and provides an alternative game plan for those ready to simplify.<br /><br />Complexity is often used as a mechanism for talking investors into unnecessary purchases, when all most need is a deeper understanding of conventional options. This book explains which issues you actually should pay attention to, and which ones are simply used for an illusion of intelligence and control.Keep up with--or beat--professional money managersExploit stock market volatility to your utmost advantageLearn where advisors and consultants fit into smart strategyBuild a portfolio that makes sense for your particular situation<br /><br />You don't have to outsmart the market if you can simply outperform it. Cut through the confusion and noise and focus on what actually matters. ""A Wealth of Common Sense"" clears the air, and gives you the insight you need to become a smarter, more successful investor.",3104527,Ben Carlson,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3104527.Ben_Carlson,4.00,1047,84,,44356784,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.FqdMO8m2llxCT8DTwgaqhw,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2021

For most of my guests, it’s the first time they’ve agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview, and the show is on the cusp of passing 100 million downloads.<br />  <br /> “This book contains the distilled tools, tactics, and ‘inside baseball’ you won’t find anywhere else. It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new ‘guests’ you haven’t met.<br />  <br /> “What makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis?<br />  <br /> “I don’t view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter. If I can’t test something and replicate results in the messy reality of everyday life, I’m not interested.<br />  <br /> “Everything within these pages has been vetted, explored, and applied to my own life in some fashion. I’ve used dozens of the tactics and philosophies in high-stakes negotiations, high-risk environments, or large business dealings. The lessons have made me millions of dollars and saved me years of wasted effort and frustration.<br />  <br /> “I created this book, my ultimate notebook of high-leverage tools, for myself. It’s changed my life, and I hope the same for you.”</div>",210456,Timothy Ferriss,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1400530891p5/210456.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1400530891p2/210456.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/210456.Timothy_Ferriss,3.93,404396,16197,2016,52480873,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.IHrwLp9-ZLoHlu7TWhH8TQ,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2021

In reality, the idea was just one of many more and far worse proposals, like personalized baseball bats and a shampoo delivery service, that Marc Randolph would pitch to his business partner, Reed Hastings, on their commute to work each morning. From this ever-shifting pool of potential ventures the pair, with Hastings as the primary investor and Randolph as the CEO, took a risk and founded Netflix. Not until years later, when a billion dollar company emerged out of a business model that - after countless disasters and flirtations with bankruptcy - seemed destined for failure would the risk pay off and become one of the mostly incredible and unlikely success stories of our time.Now with over 125 million subscribers the triumph of Netflix feels inevitable, but at a time when brick and mortar video rental stores were king and DVD technology had yet to take off, its success was far from guaranteed. From having to pitch his own mother on being an early investor, to a motel business conference room that served as a first office, to helping develop Netflix's now-famous company culture, Marc Randolph's improbable journey exemplifies how anyone with grit, gut instincts and determination can transform the world we live in. Telling his story in energetic, compelling prose, Marc chronicles the personal and professional labors that went into the creation of the unicorn company that has disrupted the very foundations of the entertainment industry.<br /><br />From having to pitch his own mother on being an early investor, to a motel business conference room that he decided would be their first office, to helping develop Netflix's now-famous company culture, Marc Randolph's improbable journey exemplifies how anyone with grit, gut instincts and determination can transform the world we live in.",18965880,Marc Randolph,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1557353143p5/18965880.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1557353143p2/18965880.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18965880.Marc_Randolph,4.21,13380,1101,,68990501,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.z1bp7abxilDqBGmBzistxQ,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

For generations, it was job security, a solidly safe investment, and an elite business education for top managers.<br /><br />GE electrified America, powering everything from lightbulbs to turbines, and became fully integrated into the American societal mindset as few companies ever had. And after two decades of leadership under legendary CEO Jack Welch, GE entered the twenty-first century as America’s most valuable corporation. Yet, fewer than two decades later, the GE of old was gone.<br /><br />​<em>Lights Out</em> examines how Welch’s handpicked successor, Jeff Immelt, tried to fix flaws in Welch’s profit machine, while stumbling headlong into mistakes of his own. In the end, GE’s traditional win-at-all-costs driven culture seemed to lose its direction, which ultimately caused the company’s decline on both a personal and organizational scale. ​<em>Lights Out</em> details how one of America’s all-time great companies has been reduced to a cautionary tale for our times.",19985068,Thomas Gryta,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19985068.Thomas_Gryta,3.93,3890,317,,73285959,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v2.d987820c-c798-4bdb-a408-5d10282b2110,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

The result is what Michael Pollan calls the American Paradox: The more we worry about nutrition, the less healthy we see to become. With <i>In Defense of Food</i>, Pollan proposes a new (and very old) answer to the question of what we should eat that comes down to seven simple but liberating words: ""Eat food. Not too much.

Isaacson’s portrait touched millions of readers.<br /><br />At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.<br /><br />Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against.<br /><br />His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.<br /><br />His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.<br /><br />Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.",7111,Walter Isaacson,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1192222433p5/7111.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1192222433p2/7111.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7111.Walter_Isaacson,4.15,1692960,41253,2011,16005831,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.MvliEan8p7Xgfe4QrGmMLw,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2021

Bezos, the richest man on the planet, has built one of the most efficient wealth-creation machines in history with 2% of US household income being spent on nearly 500 million products shipped from warehouses in seventeen countries. Amazon’s business model has not only turned the retail industry and cloud computing inside out, but now its tentacles are squeezing media and advertising, and disrupting the state of technology, the economy, job creation, and society at large. Amazon’s impact is so pervasive that business leaders in nearly every sector around the world need to understand how this force of nature operates.<br /> <br />Based on unprecedented behind-the-scenes reporting from 150 sources inside and outside of Amazon, <i>Bezonomics</i> unveils the underlying principles Jeff Bezos uses to achieve his dominance—customer obsession, extreme innovation, and long-term management, all supported by artificial intelligence—and shows how these are being borrowed and replicated by companies across the United States, in China, and elsewhere. Brian Dumaine shares tips for Amazon-proofing your business. Most important, <i>Bezonomics</i> answers the fundamental question: <i>How are Amazon and its imitators affecting the way we live, and what can we learn from them?</i><br /> <br />A goldmine for some, and a threat for others, “Bezonomics” has become a life-shaping force both now and in the future that every American must know more about.",1390410,Brian Dumaine,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1390410.Brian_Dumaine,3.75,1293,161,,73728402,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v2.a14947de-b5f7-4f72-bdcb-d93879f2f201,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

Our willingness to move, take risks, and adapt to change have produced a dynamic economy and a tradition of innovation from Ben Franklin to Steve Jobs.<br /><br />The problem, according to legendary blogger, economist and bestelling author Tyler Cowen, is that Americans today have broken from this tradition—we’re working harder than ever to <i>avoid</i> change. We're moving residences less, marrying people more like ourselves and choosing our music and our mates based on algorithms that wall us off from anything that might be too new or too different. Match.com matches us in love. Spotify and Pandora match us in music. Facebook matches us to just about everything else.<br /><br />Of course, this “matching culture” brings tremendous positives: music we like, partners who make us happy, neighbors who want the same things. We’re more <i>comfortable</i>. But, according to Cowen, there are significant collateral downsides attending this comfort, among them heightened inequality and segregation and decreased incentives to innovate and create.<br /><i></i><br /><i>The Great Social Stagnation</i> argues that this cannot go on forever. We are postponing change, due to our near-sightedness and extreme desire for comfort, but ultimately this will make change, when it comes, harder. The forces unleashed by the Great Stagnation will eventually lead to a major fiscal and budgetary crisis: impossibly expensive rentals for our most attractive cities, worsening of residential segregation, and a decline in our work ethic.

Morale had deteriorated, competition was more intense, and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company's history. ""I knew there was nothing to be gained from arguing over the past,"" Iger writes. ""The only thing that mattered was the future, and I believed I had a clear idea of the direction Disney needed to go."" It came down to three clear ideas: 1) Create the highest quality content Disney could produce. 2) Embrace and adopt technology instead of fighting it. And 3) Think bigger--think global--and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets.<br /><br />Twelve years later, Disney is the largest, most respected media company in the world counting Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and Iger is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our time.<br /><br />Now, he's sharing the lessons he's learned while running Disney and leading its 200,000 employees--taking big risks in the face of historic disruption; learning to inspire the people who work for you; leading with fairness and communicating principles clearly. This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as a studio supervisor at ABC. It's also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the evolving <i>Star Wars</i> myth.<br /><br />""Over the past fourteen years, I think I've learned so much about what real leadership is,"" Iger writes. ""But I couldn't have articulated all of this until I lived it. You can't fake it--and that's one of the key lessons in this book.""",18981546,Robert Iger,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1654191045p5/18981546.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1654191045p2/18981546.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18981546.Robert_Iger,4.42,74332,5754,,69102422,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.lNhVhFlvEQw_zRi4AGtXxg,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

Exploring the artistic challenges, technical impossibilities, marketplace demands, and Donkey Kong-sized monkey wrenches thrown into the works by corporate, <em>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels </em>reveals how bringing any game to completion is more than Sisyphean—it's nothing short of miraculous.</p><p>Taking some of the most popular, bestselling recent games, Schreier immerses readers in the hellfire of the development process, whether it's RPG studio Bioware's challenge to beat an impossible schedule and overcome countless technical nightmares to build <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>; indie developer Eric Barone's single-handed efforts to grow country-life RPG <em>Stardew Valley </em>from one man's vision into a multi-million-dollar franchise; or Bungie spinning out from their corporate overlords at Microsoft to create <em>Destiny</em>, a brand new universe that they hoped would become as iconic as <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Lord of the Rings</em>—even as it nearly ripped their studio apart. </p><p>Documenting the round-the-clock crunches, buggy-eyed burnout, and last-minute saves, <em>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels </em>is a journey through development hell—and ultimately a tribute to the dedicated diehards and unsung heroes who scale mountains of obstacles in their quests to create the best games imaginable.</p>",16222011,Jason Schreier,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16222011.Jason_Schreier,4.18,23671,2324,,55462513,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.C7j-KtwJrc14JaLlp2aIXA,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2021

Nixon had left the White House in disgrace, the nation was reeling from the catastrophe of Vietnam, and in 1979--the year the book appeared--Americans were being held hostage by Iranian militants. Yet it was exactly the anachronistic courage of his subjects that captivated Wolfe. In his foreword, he notes that as late as 1970, almost one in four career Navy pilots died in accidents. ""<i>The Right Stuff</i>,"" he explains, ""became a story of why men were willing--willing?--delighted!--to take on such odds in this, an era literary people had long since characterized as the age of the anti-hero."" <p> Wolfe's roots in New Journalism were intertwined with the nonfiction novel that Truman Capote had pioneered with <i>In Cold Blood</i>. As Capote did, Wolfe tells his story from a limited omniscient perspective, dropping into the lives of his ""characters"" as each in turn becomes a major player in the space program. After an opening chapter on the terror of being a test pilot's wife, the story cuts back to the late 1940s, when Americans were first attempting to break the sound barrier. Test pilots, we discover, are people who live fast lives with dangerous machines, not all of them airborne. Chuck Yeager was certainly among the fastest, and his determination to push through Mach 1--a feat that some had predicted would cause the destruction of any aircraft--makes him the book's guiding spirit.</p><p> Yet soon the focus shifts to the seven initial astronauts. Wolfe traces Alan Shepard's suborbital flight and Gus Grissom's embarrassing panic on the high seas (making the controversial claim that Grissom flooded his Liberty capsule by blowing the escape hatch too soon). The author also produces an admiring portrait of John Glenn's apple-pie heroism and selfless dedication. By the time Wolfe concludes with a return to Yeager and his late-career exploits, the narrative's epic proportions and literary merits are secure. Certainly <i>The Right Stuff</i> is the best, the funniest, and the most vivid book ever written about America's manned space program. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>",3083854,Tom Wolfe,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1368273666p5/3083854.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1368273666p2/3083854.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3083854.Tom_Wolfe,3.88,284498,14137,,907221,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.PIwVaPervADcjWmdfjTCHw,,,,,,,"[{'@name': 'read', '@exclusive': 'true', '@id': '291413955', '@review_shelf_id': ''}, {'@exclusive': 'false', '@id': '379042679', '@name': 'rejected', '@review_shelf_id': '3032867131', '@sortable': 'false'}]",

  <b>A stunning, deeply reported investigation into the housing crisis </b>
</b><br /><br />Spacious and affordable homes used to be the hallmark of American prosperity. Today, however, punishing rents and the increasingly prohibitive cost of ownership have turned housing into the foremost symbol of inequality and an economy gone wrong. Nowhere is this more visible than in the San Francisco Bay Area, where fleets of private buses ferry software engineers past the tarp-and-plywood shanties where the homeless make their homes. The adage that California is a glimpse of the nation's future has become a cautionary tale.<br /><br />With propulsive storytelling and ground-level reporting, <i>New York Times</i> journalist Conor Dougherty chronicles America's housing crisis from its West Coast epicenter, peeling back the decades of history and economic forces that brought us here and taking readers inside the activist uprisings that have risen in tandem with housing costs. <br /><br />To tell this new story of housing, Dougherty follows a struggling math teacher who builds a political movement dedicated to ending single-family-house neighborhoods. A teenaged girl who leads her apartment complex against their rent-raising landlord. A nun who tries to outmaneuver private equity investors by amassing a multimillion-dollar portfolio of affordable homes. A suburban bureaucrat who roguishly embraces density in response to the threat of climate change. A developer who manufactures homeless housing on an assembly line.<br /><br />Sweeping in scope and intimate in detail, <i>Golden Gates</i> definitively captures a fundamental political realignment in America as it plays out during a moment of rapid technological and social change.",19238250,Conor Dougherty,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19238250.Conor_Dougherty,4.07,2243,315,,71146758,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.DZwzXXG909ifNHucCf3VhA,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

The constant nodding, pretend concentration, useless rhetorical questions? These tricks make them seem like they know what they’re doing when in fact they have no clue. This behavior is so ingrained, so subtle, and so often mistaken for true intelligence that identifying it, calling it out, or compiling it into an exhaustive digest has never been attempted. Until now.<br /><br />Complete with illustrated tips, examples, and scenarios, <i>100 Tricks</i> gives you actionable ways to use words like 'actionable', in order to sound smart. Every type of meeting is covered, from general meetings where you stopped paying attention almost immediately, to one-on-one meetings you zoned out on, to impromptu meetings you were painfully subjected to at the last minute. It’s all here.<br /><br />Open this book to any page and find an easy-to-digest trick with an even easier-to-digest illustration, guiding you on: how to nail the big meeting by pacing and nodding, the most effective ways to listen to your coworkers while still completely ignoring them, and the key to making your presentations 'interactive'.<br /><br />If you hadn’t noticed these behaviors before, you will see them now - from your colleagues, your managers, and soon yourself.

In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by <i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, the <i>Modern Library</i>, and the <i>London Observer</i>.<br /><br />Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.<br /><br />This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more.

  </b>
  <b> will train you to combat your own biases, address your weaknesses, and help you become a better and more confident decision-maker.</b>
</b><br /><br />What do you do when you're faced with a big decision? If you're like most people, you use a pro and con list, spend a lot of time second guessing or regretting decisions that don't work out, get caught in analysis paralysis, endlessly seeking other people's opinions and trying to find just that little bit more information that might make you sure, or you do the opposite and just go with your gut feeling. But this is exactly the wrong way to go about combating the biases working against you. What if there was a better way to make quality decisions so you can think clearly, feel more confident, second guess yourself less, and ultimately be more decisive and be more productive?<br /><br />The good news is that decision-making is not a matter of luck or smarts, but a teachable skill that anyone can get better at. And the great news is that even a small improvement in decision-making will make a huge impact on your life. In <i>How to Decid</i>e, bestselling author and former professional poker player Annie Duke lays out a series of tools anyone can use to make better decisions. You'll learn how to identify and dismantle hidden biases and accept that you can rarely be certain of how things will turn out.<br /><br />Through practical exercises and engaging thought experiments, this book helps you analyze key decisions you've made in the past and troubleshoot those you're making in the future. Whether you're picking investments, evaluating a job offer, or trying to figure out your romantic life, this book is the key to happier outcomes and fewer regrets.",312231,Annie Duke,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1521558804p5/312231.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1521558804p2/312231.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/312231.Annie_Duke,3.95,25472,2610,,71475022,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.P0kvONxHxt6yjadqh9YJSA,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

Food availability, income, and life span are up; disease, child mortality, and violence are down — all across the globe. Though the world is far from perfect, necessities and luxuries alike are getting cheaper; population growth is slowing; Africa is following Asia out of poverty; the Internet, the mobile phone, and container shipping are enriching people’s lives as never before. The pessimists who dominate public discourse insist that we will soon reach a turning point and things will start to get worse. But they have been saying this for two hundred years.</p><p>Yet Matt Ridley does more than describe how things are getting better. He explains why. Prosperity comes from everybody working for everybody else. The habit of exchange and specialization—which started more than 100,000 years ago—has created a collective brain that sets human living standards on a rising trend. The mutual dependence, trust, and sharing that result are causes for hope, not despair.</p><p>This bold book covers the entire sweep of human history, from the Stone Age to the Internet, from the stagnation of the Ming empire to the invention of the steam engine, from the population explosion to the likely consequences of climate change. It ends with a confident assertion that thanks to the ceaseless capacity of the human race for innovative change, and despite inevitable disasters along the way, the twenty-first century will see both human prosperity and natural biodiversity enhanced.

  <b>Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings reveals for the first time the unorthodox culture behind one of the world's most innovative, imaginative, and successful companies</b>
</b><br /><br />There has never before been a company like Netflix. It has led nothing short of a revolution in the entertainment industries, generating billions of dollars in annual revenue while capturing the imaginations of hundreds of millions of people in over 190 countries. But to reach these great heights, Netflix, which launched in 1998 as an online DVD rental service, has had to reinvent itself over and over again. This type of unprecedented flexibility would have been impossible without the counterintuitive and radical management principles that cofounder Reed Hastings established from the very beginning. Hastings rejected the conventional wisdom under which other companies operate and defied tradition to instead build a culture focused on freedom and responsibility, one that has allowed Netflix to adapt and innovate as the needs of its members and the world have simultaneously transformed.<br /><br />Hastings set new standards, valuing people over process, emphasizing innovation over efficiency, and giving employees context, not controls. At Netflix, there are no vacation or expense policies. At Netflix, adequate performance gets a generous severance, and hard work is irrel-evant. At Netflix, you don't try to please your boss, you give candid feedback instead. At Netflix, employees don't need approval, and the company pays top of market. When Hastings and his team first devised these unorthodox principles, the implications were unknown and untested. But in just a short period, their methods led to unparalleled speed and boldness, as Netflix quickly became one of the most loved brands in the world.<br /><br />Here for the first time, Hastings and Erin Meyer, bestselling author of <i>The Culture Map </i>and one of the world's most influential business thinkers, dive deep into the controversial ideologies at the heart of the Netflix psyche, which have generated results that are the envy of the business world. Drawing on hundreds of interviews with current and past Netflix employees from around the globe and never-before-told stories of trial and error from Hastings's own career, <i>No Rules Rules </i>is the fascinating and untold account of the philosophy behind one of the world's most innovative, imaginative, and successful companies.",19792006,Reed Hastings,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19792006.Reed_Hastings,4.29,23651,2190,,74541588,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.UQYj_KeYPB5Vlu3p,read,true,291413955,,,,,2020

The cofounders started to cultivate a community of photographers and artisans around the app, but it quickly went mainstream. In less than two years, it caught Facebook’s attention: Mark Zuckerberg bought the company for a historic $1 billion when Instagram was just 13 employees.<br /> <br />That might have been the end of a classic success story. But the cofounders stayed on, trying to maintain Instagram’s beauty, brand, and cachet, considering their app a separate company within the social networking giant. They urged their employees to make changes only when necessary, resisting Facebook’s grow-at-all-costs philosophy in favor of a strategy that highlighted creativity and celebrity. Just as Instagram was about to reach 1 billion users, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg—once supportive of the founders’ autonomy—began to feel threatened by Instagram’s success.<br /> <br />At its heart, <i>No Filter</i> is a human story, as Sarah Frier uncovers how the company’s decisions have fundamentally changed how we interact with the world around us. Frier draws on unprecedented exclusive access—from the founders of Instagram, as well as employees, executives, and competitors; Anna Wintour of <i>Vogue</i>; Kris Jenner of the Kardashian-Jenner empire; and a plethora of influencers, from fashionistas with millions of followers to owners of famous dogs worldwide—to show how Instagram has fundamentally changed the way we shop, eat, travel, and communicate, all while fighting to preserve the values which contributed to the company’s success. <i>No Filter</i> examines how Instagram’s dominance acts as lens into our society today, highlighting our fraught relationship with technology, our desire for perfection, and the battle within tech for its most valuable commodity: our attention.",19284946,Sarah Frier,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1566424706p5/19284946.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1566424706p2/19284946.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19284946.Sarah_Frier,4.12,9368,1071,,71431858,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.I41AuOK00b3YkjxQ394oXw,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i> chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical student ""possessed,"" as he wrote, ""by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"" into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. <br /><br />What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir. <br /><br />Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. ""I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"" he wrote. ""Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'"" <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i> is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.",14031444,Paul Kalanithi,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1456068631p5/14031444.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1456068631p2/14031444.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14031444.Paul_Kalanithi,4.39,604918,46135,,45424659,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.oip55amienPK71A-wDcRGg,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

</p><br /><p>Once described by the <em>Washington Post</em> as “the most interesting mayor you’ve never heard of,” Pete Buttigieg, the thirty-six-year-old Democratic mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has improbably emerged as one of the nation’s most visionary politicians. First elected in 2011, Buttigieg left a successful business career to move back to his hometown, previously tagged by Newsweek as a “dying city,” because the industrial Midwest beckoned as a challenge to the McKinsey-trained Harvard graduate. Whether meeting with city residents on middle-school basketball courts, reclaiming abandoned houses, confronting gun violence, or attracting high-tech industry, Buttigieg has transformed South Bend into a shining model of urban reinvention.</p><br /><p>While Washington reels with scandal, <em>Shortest Way Home</em> interweaves two once-unthinkable success stories: that of an Afghanistan veteran who came out and found love and acceptance, all while in office, and that of a Rust Belt city so thoroughly transformed that it shatters the way we view America’s so-called flyover country.</p>",18045362,Pete Buttigieg,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1553791468p5/18045362.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1553791468p2/18045362.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18045362.Pete_Buttigieg,4.19,19406,2645,2019,62339652,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.-naTLPsa6xbKEjDWOIL2hg,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

In the past decade, Silicon Valley companies like Google, Tesla and Uber have positioned themselves to revolutionize the way we move around by developing driverless vehicles while traditional auto companies like General Motors, Ford, and Daimler have been fighting back by partnering by with new tech start-ups. It’s not a question of whether the self-driving car will disrupt the automobile industry; it’s a question of when, how, and who will win the race.<br /><br />With the first driverless car likely to hit markets in less than five years, Burns also looks toward the future and explains how this new technology will impact our lives—from removing the hassles of driving, parking, and refueling our cars, to eliminating 90 percent of road fatalities, drastically reducing our carbon footprint, and automating yet another segment of blue collar industries, putting more workers out of their jobs.<br /><br />We are on the brink of a technological revolution that promises to fundamentally change how we interact with our world. A chronicle of the past, diagnosis of the present, and prediction of the future, <em>Autonomy</em> is the ultimate guide to understanding the driverless car and to navigating the revolution it sparks.",3189685,Lawrence D.

One thing, primarily: the collaboration between technology and capitalism. In <i>More From Less</i>, McAfee explains how capitalism’s quest for higher profits is a quest for lower costs; materials and resources are expensive, and technological progress allows companies to use fewer of them even as they grow their markets. Modern smartphones take the place of cameras, GPS units, landline telephones, answering machines, tape recorders, and alarm clocks. Precision agriculture lets farmers harvest larger crops while using less water and fertilizer. Passenger cars get lighter, which makes them cheaper to produce and more fuel efficient. This means that, even though there’ll be more people in the future, and they’ll be wealthier and consume more, they’ll do so while using fewer natural resources.<br /><br /> However, the future is not <i>all </i>bright, cautions McAfee. He warns of issues that haven’t been solved, like overfishing and global warming. But overall, <i>More From Less</i> is a revelatory, paradigm-shifting account of how we’ve stumbled into an unexpected balance with nature, and the possibility that our most abundant centuries are ahead of us.",2865914,Andrew McAfee,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1263814817p5/2865914.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1263814817p2/2865914.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2865914.Andrew_McAfee,3.91,17198,1407,,68194583,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.oL7Y4TW_XuLo5jz818Cj1g,read,true,291413955,,true,true,,2020

Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, ""we have no theory.""<br /><br />Frankfurt, one of the world's most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all.<br /><br />Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner's capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.",219,Harry G.

Dr. Makary, one of the nation's leading health care experts, travels across America and details why health care has become a bubble. Drawing from on-the-ground stories, his research, and his own experience, <i>The Price We Pay</i> paints a vivid picture of price-gouging, middlemen, and a series of elusive money games in need of a serious shake-up. Dr. Makary shows how so much of health care spending goes to things that have nothing to do with health and what you can do about it. Dr. Makary challenges the medical establishment to remember medicine's noble heritage of caring for people when they are vulnerable.<br /><br /><i>The Price We Pay</i> offers a roadmap for everyday Americans and business leaders to get a better deal on their health care, and profiles the disruptors who are innovating medical care.

Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.<br /><br />Marketers at Procter &amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.<br /><br />An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.<br /><br />What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives.<br /><br />They succeeded by transforming habits.<br /><br />In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.<br /><br />Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.<br /><br />At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.<br /><br />Habits aren’t destiny.

A completely practical approach delivered with a nonjudgmental style that makes readers want to do what Sethi says, it is based around the four pillars of personal finance— banking, saving, budgeting, and investing—and the wealth-building ideas of personal entrepreneurship.<br /><br />Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indian—the conversation begins with ""no""; why ""Budgeting Doesn't Have to Suck!""; how to get things rolling—for real—with only $20; what most people don't understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food. Not to mention his first key lesson: Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in the room. Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security.<br /><br />Every month, 175,000 unique visitors come to Ramit Sethi's website, Iwillteachyoutoberich.com, to discover the path to financial freedom. They praise him thoughtfully (""Your site summarizes everything I want with my life—to be rich in finances, rich in experience, rich in family blessings,"" --Dan Esparza) and effusively (""Dude, you rock. I love this site!"" --Richard Wu). The press has caught on, too: ""Ramit Sethi is a rising star in the world of personal finance writing . . . one singularly attuned to the sensibilities of his generation. his style is part frat boy and part silicon Valley geek, with a little bit of San Francisco hipster thrown in"" (San Francisco Chronicle).

In 1913 Ramanujan, a 25-year-old clerk who had flunked out of two colleges, wrote a letter filled with startlingly original theorems to eminent English mathematician G. H. Hardy. Struck by the Indian's genius, Hardy, member of the Cambridge Apostles and an obsessive cricket aficionado, brought Ramanujan to England. Over the next five years, the vegetarian Brahmin who claimed his discoveries were revealed to him by a Hindu goddess turned out influential mathematical propositions. Cut off from his young Indian wife left at home and emotionally neglected by fatherly yet aloof Hardy, Ramanujan returned to India in 1919, depressed, sullen and quarrelsome; he died one year later of tuberculosis.

For the first time, the major developed economies began to invest more in intangible assets, like design, branding, R&amp;D, and software, than in tangible assets, like machinery, buildings, and computers. For all sorts of businesses, from tech firms and pharma companies to coffee shops and gyms, the ability to deploy assets that one can neither see nor touch is increasingly the main source of long-term success.<br /><br />But this is not just a familiar story of the so-called new economy. <i>Capitalism without Capital</i> shows that the growing importance of intangible assets has also played a role in some of the big economic changes of the last decade. The rise of intangible investment is, Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake argue, an underappreciated cause of phenomena from economic inequality to stagnating productivity.<br /><br />Haskel and Westlake bring together a decade of research on how to measure intangible investment and its impact on national accounts, showing the amount different countries invest in intangibles, how this has changed over time, and the latest thinking on how to assess this. They explore the unusual economic characteristics of intangible investment, and discuss how these features make an intangible-rich economy fundamentally different from one based on tangibles.<br /><br /><i>Capitalism without Capital</i> concludes by presenting three possible scenarios for what the future of an intangible world might be like, and by outlining how managers, investors, and policymakers can exploit the characteristics of an intangible age to grow their businesses, portfolios, and economies.",16758966,Jonathan Haskel,,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png,true,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16758966.Jonathan_Haskel,3.78,2251,227,,56192358,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.690V9pLZTnP7mbgfEG2qtw,read,true,291413955,,,,,2019

But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.<br /><br />In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form.

How many gay people are still in the closet? Do we truly live in a postracial society? Has Twitter made us dumber? These are just a few of the questions Christian Rudder answers in <i>Dataclysm,</i> a smart, funny, irreverent look at how we act when we think no one’s looking.<br />  <br /> For centuries we’ve relied on polling or small-scale lab experiments to study human behavior. Today a new approach is possible. As we live more of our lives online, researchers can finally observe us directly, in vast numbers and without filters. Data scientists can quantify the formerly unquantifiable and show with unprecedented precision how we fight, how we age, how we love, and how we change. Our personal data has been used to spy on us, hire and fire us, and sell us stuff we don’t need. In <i>Dataclysm,</i> Rudder uses it to show us who we are as people. <br />  <br /> He reveals how Facebook ""likes"" can predict, with surprising accuracy, a person’s sexual orientation and even intelligence; how attractive women receive exponentially more job interview requests; and why you have to have haters to be hot. He charts the rise and fall of America’s most reviled word through Google Search and examines the new dynamics of collaborative rage on Twitter. He shows how people express themselves, both privately and publically. What is the least Asian thing you can say? Do people bathe more in Vermont or New Jersey? What do black women think about Simon &amp; Garfunkel? Hint: They don’t think about Simon &amp; Garfunkel. Rudder also tracks human migration in real time, showing how groups of people move from certain small towns to the same big cities across the globe. And he grapples with the challenge of maintaining privacy in a world where these explorations are possible.<br />  <br /> Provocative, illuminating, and visually arresting, <i>Dataclysm</i> is a portrait of our essential selves—and a first look at a revolution in the making.",8058863,Christian Rudder,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1540221691p5/8058863.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1540221691p2/8058863.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8058863.Christian_Rudder,3.74,11809,1244,,40787528,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.IwF9oDLPiZxvp1-fQcuXDw,read,true,291413955,,,,,2019

Offices across the State Department sit empty, while abroad the military-industrial complex has assumed the work once undertaken by peacemakers. We’re becoming a nation that shoots first and asks questions later.<br /><br />In an astonishing account ranging from Washington, D.C., to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and North Korea in the years since 9/11, acclaimed journalist and former diplomat Ronan Farrow illuminates one of the most consequential and poorly understood changes in American history. His firsthand experience in the State Department affords a personal look at some of the last standard-bearers of traditional statecraft, including Richard Holbrooke, who made peace in Bosnia and died while trying to do so in Afghanistan. Farrow’s narrative is richly informed by interviews with whistleblowers, policymakers, and a warlord, from Henry Kissinger to Hillary Clinton. Diplomacy, Farrow argues, has declined after decades of political cowardice, short-sightedness, and outright malice—but it may just offer America a way out of a world at war.",17176042,Ronan Farrow,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1621450505p5/17176042.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1621450505p2/17176042.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17176042.Ronan_Farrow,4.39,100918,10990,,59177610,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.RumlaqXE9AQ1Tn7l3KswWg,read,true,291413955,,,,,2019

Their reflections are thematic in nature, discussing the influence &amp; effect upon history of certain qualities, institutions &amp; movements: race, character, moral systems, religion, socialism, government, war etc. Their overall conclusion is at once optimistic &amp; realistic; the phenomenon of progress is no figment of the historian's imagination; it's real, in the sense that each generation is born to a heritage richer than that received by their fathers. Thus, the 20th century is the most blessed of all eras so far, from a cultural standpoint, for it has assimilated the best of the Periclean Greeks, of the Renaissance, of the Voltairian age etc. The Durants' ""Story"" is, despite the cavils of a few disputatious historians, the historical synthesis par excellence for the intelligent nonspecialist.

But they experience something new, too: an industry forever changed by the massive financial collapse of 2008. And as they get their Wall Street educations, they face hard questions about morality, prestige, and the value of their work.<br /><br />YOUNG MONEY is more than an exposé of excess; it's the story of how the financial crisis changed a generation-and remade Wall Street from the bottom up.",1489977,Kevin Roose,,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1615759510p5/1489977.jpg,false,https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1615759510p2/1489977.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1489977.Kevin_Roose,3.90,18154,1983,,25073498,kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.2Uv2L9C_FLzNqJBgmDhPgQ,read,true,291413955,,,,,2019
